# Artless Cards

_**aka Alison, why?**_


This mod adds support for cards that do not have art. The description will be realligned, and a new frame will be drawn to encompass the entire description.

To use Artless Cards, simply set the Artless flag to true
```java
ArtlessField.isArtless.set(this, true);
```

You will need to make new cardbacks to accomodate the new frame design. Included are 3 _very_ rough reference images you can work with. Also included are 3 examples of how to cover up your mistakes with fancy cardbackgrounds.
